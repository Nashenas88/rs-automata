# RS-Automata

This is a "soft" fork of [https://github.com/TanTanDev/3d_celluar_automata]. I'm rewriting it using the latest available versions of the same libraries, though at first I'm copying the contents of the project to--hopefully--understand graphics programming better. 

This first push isn't compiling.
